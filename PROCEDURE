put that gem in your gemfile " gem 'rails4-autocomplete' "
bundle install that bitch

so we actually don't run the generator for 4+
we manually install dependencies :(

so first we add jquery / jquery-ujs / jquery-ui
   - add jquery-3.2.1.min.js to /app/assets/javascripts
   - include it in application.html.erb
